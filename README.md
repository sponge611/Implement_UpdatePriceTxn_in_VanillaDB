# Goal
In this assignment, we are asked to
  - implement a new transaction - **UpdateItemPriceTxn**, which will randomly select some items and update their price, in the vanillaDB benchmark project.
  - modify `org.vanilladb.bench.StatisticMgr` in order to make it produce an additional report with more information.

For detailed introduction and experiment results, please read the report(in Chinese).
